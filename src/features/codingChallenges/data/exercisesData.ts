        explanation: `
  **What is \`reduce()\`?**
  
  \`reduce()\` is a built-in JavaScript method on arrays. It processes each element of your array in turn, 
  carrying along an "accumulator" that represents your ongoing result. The method looks like this:
  
  \`\`\`js
  array.reduce(function callback(accumulator, currentValue, currentIndex, array) {
    // Return the updated accumulator
  }, initialValue);
  \`\`\`
  
  - **accumulator**: A variable you keep updating with each element.
  - **currentValue**: The array element \`reduce\` is looking at during the current iteration.
  - **currentIndex**: The position of \`currentValue\` in the array (not always needed, but sometimes handy).
  - **array**: The entire array (useful if you need more context).
  - **initialValue** (optional): If you supply this, \`accumulator\` starts at this value. 
    If you don't, the first array element becomes your initial \`accumulator\`.
  
  **How to Sum with \`reduce()\`:**
  1. Provide an \`initialValue\` of \`0\`. This tells \`reduce\` to start counting from zero.
  2. In the callback, add \`currentValue\` to \`accumulator\`.
  3. Return the \`accumulator\` each time so it can carry that sum forward.
  4. After the last element, \`reduce\` returns the final total.
  
  This is simpler than writing a loop manually and makes it clear you're producing a *single* result from all elements.

        concept: "Finding the Maximum with reduce()",
        explanation: `
  **How does \`reduce()\` work in general?**
  
  \`reduce\` runs a callback on each array element, updating an \`accumulator\` (some variable) along the way. 
  You can write the callback like this:
  
  \`\`\`js
  array.reduce(function callback(accumulator, currentValue, currentIndex, entireArray) {
    // logic to update accumulator
    return updatedAccumulator;
  }, initialValue);
  \`\`\`
  
  **Finding the Maximum**:
  1. If you don't supply an \`initialValue\`, the first array element becomes your accumulator.
  2. On each iteration, compare \`accumulator\` with \`currentValue\`.
  3. Keep whichever one is largerâ€”this becomes the new \`accumulator\`.
  4. By the end, \`accumulator\` is the maximum.
  
  **Empty Arrays**: 
  - If there's no element to start with, you should return \`null\`.
  
  **One-Element Arrays**:
  - That element is the maximum by default.
  
  Thus, \`reduce\` can do more than summation; it can track *any* evolving condition, 
  like "What's the largest so far?" in a single pass.

  // - 1st iteration: maxSoFar = 5 (first element)
  // - Compare 5 with 2 -> keep 5
  // - Compare 5 with 9 -> update to 9
  // - Compare 9 with 1 -> keep 9

  **General \`reduce\` Recap**:
  \`reduce\` takes a callback function that receives four parameters:
  \`\`\`js
  function callback(accumulator, currentValue, currentIndex, array) {
    // modify accumulator in some way
    return accumulator;
  }
  \`\`\`
  - \`accumulator\` here can be **anything**â€”a number, string, object, etc.
  
  **Counting Approach**:
  1. Provide an empty object (\`{}\`) as the \`initialValue\`. Then \`accumulator\` will be that object.
  2. During each iteration, use \`currentValue\` (the array element) as a key in \`accumulator\`.
  3. Increment the value stored at that key. If it doesn't exist yet, initialize it to 1.
  4. At the end, the \`accumulator\` is an object mapping each unique element to the number of occurrences.
  
  This lets you transform an array of items into a frequency count in **one single pass**.
